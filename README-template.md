### Links 🔗

- [Github](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/fem-stats-preview-card-component) - I certainly hope you're checking out this awesome-sauce README that I spent a fun evening composing!
- [Live link](https://fem-huddle-landing-page-jade.vercel.app/) - And also hope you, spectacular 🌟 you, have the time to impart your so-appreciated code reviews to me.  

## My Process 🤔

### Built with 🛠
- Semantic HTML5 markup - _I'd forgotten this on my last challenge, which I blame React for!_ 🤣
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- `position: absolute`
- Flexbox

### What I learned 📜

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development 🎓

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources 📚

- [Font-size Clamp Generator](https://clamp.font-size.app/) - This tool allows you to set the smallest and largest font size, then it will scale automatically.

- [Viewport Resizer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-resizer-%E2%80%93-respon/kapnjjcfcncngkadhpmijlkblpibdcgm/related?hl=en) - This makes it so much faster to check out different screen sizes.

- [mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This was the color mode property I was searching for!


## Author 🤪
<hr>

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**.  

I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, _for a little bit_ 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

But that was then! 

...

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! :dancer:  I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

### My journey 📆

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022.  I finally learned **JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset.  If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out **[Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT).**

Then I met an awesome group of fellow-learning devs, **The Explorers**.  This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now!  But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the coveted T-shirt! 🎉👕

But who cares about 2022? This is 2023!

...

I've been boning up on **React**, and just taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!

One of those courses has seen me going back to **Python** - which I had treated as my _crutch language_ to understand JavaScript.  🤣  But I've been loving navigating in multiple languages.

Another challenge I am undertaking this year is [Exercism's](https://exercism.org/) **#12in23**.  This is a cool 😎 opportunity to _try out_ 12 different languages this year.  Each month has a theme, like **Functional February** and **Mechanical March** to encourage you to check out different language paradims.  I'm loving this chance to dip my toe in other types of programming.  I find I'm gaining the ability to evaluate various languages' strengths and project needs.

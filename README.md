## Author 🤪
<hr>

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**.  

I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, _for a little bit_ 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

But that was then! 

...

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! :dancer:  I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

### My journey 📆

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022.  I finally learned **JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset.  If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out **[Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT).**

Then I met an awesome group of fellow-learning devs, **The Explorers**.  This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now!  But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the coveted T-shirt! 🎉👕

But who cares about 2022? This is 2023!

...

I've been boning up on **React**, and just taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!

One of those courses has seen me going back to **Python** - which I had treated as my _crutch language_ to understand JavaScript.  🤣  But I've been loving navigating in multiple languages.

Another challenge I am undertaking this year is [Exercism's](https://exercism.org/) **#12in23**.  This is a cool 😎 opportunity to _try out_ 12 different languages this year.  Each month has a theme, like **Functional February** and **Mechanical March** to encourage you to check out different language paradims.  I'm loving this chance to dip my toe in other types of programming.  I find I'm gaining the ability to evaluate various languages' strengths and project needs.
